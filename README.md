# 👋 Hey, I’m Rohit  
### I build AI systems that make sense — and actually get used.

Most AI projects fail not because the models are bad,  
but because the **problem wasn’t clear**, the **data wasn’t ready**,  
or the **solution didn’t fit real workflows**.

That’s the gap I enjoy working in.

## 🧠 What I Do
I’m a **Data Science graduate student at UMBC** working at the intersection of  
**data, machine learning, and applied AI systems**.

I focus on:
- Turning messy data into **reliable signals**
- Building **simple ML/AI systems** that scale
- Translating analysis into **decisions people can act on**

No hype. No overengineering. Just systems that work.

## 🔍 How I Think
- **Start with the problem**, not the model  
- **Data quality > model complexity**  
- **Systems beat tools**  
- If it can’t be explained simply, it’s not done
