# Hi, I’m Rohit 👋  
### Data Scientist | AI & ML Engineer | Turning Data into Real-World Impact

I’m a **Data Science graduate student at UMBC** with a strong interest in **applied AI, machine learning, analytics, and automation**.  
I enjoy building systems that move beyond theory — focusing on **clarity, scalability, and real outcomes**.

---

## 🚀 What I Work On
- 📊 Data analysis & visualization that drives decisions  
- 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning (NLP, time-series, classification)  
- 🧠 Applied AI systems (LLMs, automation, summarization, agents)  
- ⚙️ End-to-end pipelines: data → model → deployment → insights  

I care deeply about **data quality**, **interpretability**, and **solving the right problem before choosing the tool**.
